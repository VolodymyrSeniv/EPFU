Report 3 

We decided to divided our program into 3 parts. main.c, main.h, IOput.h are files with functions 
and variables used in automatic and interactive mode. Interactive.c and interactive.h contains 
code need in interactive mode, the same with auto.c and auto.h, they are used in automatic version.
All the functions we used works on global variables: struct Field** Map, struct Player players_data[9]
and other variables to store data like number of players and size of the board.


Main functions:
void GenerateMap(); 
void DrawMap(); 
int Placement(int ID); 
int Movement(/*int row_id, int column_id*/);
void Placement(); 
void Movement();
void createOutputFile(char* name); 
int ReadMap(char* name); 

The describtion of the functions are in the both .c and .h files.

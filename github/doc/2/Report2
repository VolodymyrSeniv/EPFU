Code main loop and interaction with user.

User interaction idea:
We decided to use the console as the game environment. Player using keyboard will interact with game. 
We used scanf() to read data from user and printf() to show the data in the console.

Data structure:
We used the global (multi-files) variables declared in .c files and their extern declarations are in .h files.

Variables:
nplayers - number of players
x - number of rows
y - number of colums
penguins - number of penguins
players - table with players' ID

We decided to hold the board data as the two dimensional array of structures. 
The strucuture looks like that:
struct Field
{
    int fish;
    int penguin;
}
where penguin is the number of penguin on this field and fish is number of fish on this field.
